# How It Works
With the help (limitations too üò™), I found a few metrics that may help to build a rough image of a Dribbbler:

* **Appreciation**: based on *( favs + buckets ) / views* for recent shots.
* **Attractions**: based on *the percentage of followers who have 100+ followers*.
* **Diligence**: based on *total shots / total years since joined Dribbble*.
* **Engagement**: based on *( comment + rebounds ) / views* for recent shots.
* **Influence**: based on *followers / total years since joined Dribbble*.

And the **Total Score** is a weighted mean of the 5 scores above.This system is pretty subject, and please be free to advice me for better ideas.
